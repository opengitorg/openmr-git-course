**This course is based on materials by [Software Carpentry](http://www.software-carpentry.org)**

> ## Prerequisites
> In this lesson we use Git from the Unix Shell. Some previous experience with the shell is expected, *but it is not mandatory*.
> We will be explaining the necessary commands during the tutorial.
>
> You're invited to follow along during the *Introduction to Git(Hub)* session of [OpenMR Virtual 2021](https://openmrbenelux.github.io/)!
> However, if you feel lost or too far behind, this material will help you catch up with us! We will leave this material online after the event, to leave you with a reference for your git usage!
>
> To follow the tutorial, you can use your **favorite terminal** on Unix systems (any Linux or Mac OS), or **WSL** on Windows.
> If you do not have **WSL** or you prefer something different, you can use **git bash**.
> Please refer to the [setup page](/setup/) if you need help in setting up git!
>
> We will try our best to avoid using platform-dependent commands or programs, but it might happen to use a text editor.
> You can use your favorite one (vi, vim, gedit, atom, sublime, notepad, ...) - but remember to set it as default editor when you configure git!
>
> You will need a GitHub account for this tutorial.
> Please sign up [here](https://github.com/) if you do not already have one!
