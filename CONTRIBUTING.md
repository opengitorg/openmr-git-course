# Contributing

Contributions of any kind are welcome! If you spot a typo, or feel like a sentence might need rewording, please indicate it!
We are not native English speakers, and despite the fact that we do our best, some things just slip away...

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our license](LICENSE.md).

## How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling mistake,
some awkward wording, or a factual error.
This is a great chance to try out GitHub!

1.  If you do not have a [GitHub][github] account, [create one][github-join]!

2.  If you have a [GitHub][github] account, but do not know how to use Git,
    you can report problems or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][issues].
    This allows us to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

3.  If you are comfortable with Git, you can submit a pull request (PR).
    Instructions for doing this are [included below](#using-github).

## Where to Contribute

If you wish to change this lesson, please work in [the repo][repo], which can be viewed [here][website].

## What *Not* to Contribute

Our lessons already contain more material than we can cover in a typical workshop,
so we are usually *not* looking for more concepts or tools to add to them.
As a rule,
if you want to introduce a new idea,
you must (a) estimate how long it will take to teach
and (b) explain what you would take out to make room for it.
The first encourages contributors to be honest about requirements;
the second, to think hard about priorities.

Remember that you can take this material and adapt it to your necessities without any problem (see [our license](LICENSE.md))

## Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub,
you may want to look at
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute].
In brief:

1.  The published copy of the lesson is in the `gh-pages` branch of the repository
    (so that GitHub will regenerate it automatically).
    Please create all branches from that,
    and merge the [master repository][repo]'s `gh-pages` branch into your `gh-pages` branch
    before starting work.
    Please do *not* work directly in your `gh-pages` branch,
    since that will make it difficult for you to work on other contributions.

2.  We use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes:
    1.  Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each significant change.
    2.  Commit the change in that branch.
    3.  Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.
    4.  Submit a pull request from that branch to the [master repository][repo].
    5.  If you receive feedback,
        make changes on your desktop and push to your branch on GitHub:
        the pull request will update automatically.
