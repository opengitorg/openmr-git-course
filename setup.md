## Software
Git is a free and open-source software, available for all operating systems.
If you are using Windows to follow this course, you should open `Git BASH` (see Installation).

```
git --version
```
If you don't have it, follow [this page](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install it.

### Installation for Windows
[Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) is a quick way to have git installed on your Windows machine.
