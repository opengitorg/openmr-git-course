## Introduction to Git(Hub)
This is an adapted version of the git course from Software Carpentry and the University of Manchester git course materials. We specifically adapted it for the [OpenMR Virtual 2021](https://openmrbenelux.github.io/) workshop: "Introduction to Git(Hub)".

You can have a look at this material beforehand, and use it if you find yourself lost during the workshop itself, but if you can, we suggest to follow the interactive session! This material will remain available as a reference after the event.
